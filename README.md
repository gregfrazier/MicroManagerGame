# MicroManagerGame
JavaScript + Canvas + Pixel Art + Game&amp;Watch = Micro Manager The Game

In this game you are a manager of the micro-kind. You really like to keep your subordinates in line by visiting them at their desk constantly and giving them as much work as you can, even if you have make it up. No, you don't have task management software and even if you did, you don't have time to learn that crap, you have MANAGEMENT to do!

In this microworld, every second that goes by in realtime is a minute to your employees. It's 4:59PM, nearly quitting time, but you want that bonus this year so you need to make your employees stay late as possible. They are sneaky though and will leave immediately after finishing their work, so keep them piled up for the next hour (60 seconds in realtime.)

So visit your office to grab some work (step in front of your door and press SPACE) and assign it to your employees (step beside an employee and press SPACE), but watch their timers! Not all work is equal so some work may get done faster than others and if the timer runs out the employee will go home. If you need an extra boost, visit the coffee machine 5 (step beside it and press SPACE to drink coffee) times and the next workload you send out will add 5 seconds to the employee's timer (there's a bug I dont care to fix that will remove time btw.)

Controls:

Arrow keys - move

Space - action (give work, get work, drink coffee)

60 seconds to keep your employees active, you can still "win" if you get to the end with at least one employee. If you lose them all before time runs out, you "lose" but because the game is based on micromanagement, I guess you really do win.

I made this to look like a Game &amp; Watch game and also to be boring. There's nothing fun when micromanagement is involved.
